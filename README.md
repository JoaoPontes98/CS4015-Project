# CS4015-Project: Daily Planner
For this project, we have created a simple Daily Planner app using Java. The app allows users to create To-Do Lists on different days of the calendar year to track their tasks. Currently, the main features include the ability to create different lists of tasks, create appointment tasks and recurring tasks, and organize tasks into sublists within a day's list.

This app is intended to showcase the use of different design patterns and extendable code. The main design patterns used include the Composite, Decorator, Prototype, and Singleton patterns, as well as making use of abstract classes, interfaces, and subclassing.

The app's source code, written in Java and mainly utilizing Java Swing for the UI components, can be found in the src folder.   
The app's documentation provides a more in depth look at the functions, how to use the app, how the app functions, and what design patterns it utilizes. It can be found in the  doc folder.
